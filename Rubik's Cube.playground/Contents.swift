//    ==============================
//               ï£¿ WWDC17
//
//    - Please test on an iPad (not iPad Pro)
//    - It's designed for lanscape mode
//    - It's best when the playground view is fullscreen and not halfway (start it on full screen before everything loads)
//    - Hope you enjoy my playground!

let playArea = PlayArea() // sets up the play area (scenes & views)
let rubiks = RubiksCube(area: playArea) // attachs the cube to the scenes and starts gameplay
